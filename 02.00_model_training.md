### Data Processing

Data was prepared for train/test as follows:

1. Read both CSV datasets from the HAR data website.
2. Review data and identify null values since their values need to be removed or imputed. The dataset was subset to remove columns which contained all zero values.
3. Dataset dimension before and after subset were used to verify results.

* The course mentor guides for random forest modeling was referenced to setup model training. Confusion matrix was used to verify results.
