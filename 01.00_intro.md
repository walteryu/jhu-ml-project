2. Some charts and analysis output have been commented out to minimize overall length of document. Given project scope, it was a challenge to document all work while keeping document below maximum page length.

3. The course mentor [example project][01.01] and [model training example][01.02]  were referenced while developing this project to resolve issues with random forest model training times which were excessive without parallel processing.
