### Model Training

As described in the introduction, random forest was selected for its performance capability and relevance for the prediction task. Model training was completed as follows:

1. Configure parallel and doParallel package for model training.
2. Create and configure trainControl object to run parallel process.
3. Perform cross validation using trainControl object.
4. Train model with random forest and stop cluster when done.
5. Review model fit summary and confusion matrix to verify results.

* Note: The course mentor guides for random forest modeling was referenced to setup model training. Confusion matrix was used to verify results.
