### Data Processing

Data was prepared for train/test as follows:

1. Read in train and test data files with na.string option to flag null values.
2. Review data and identify null values since their values need to be removed or imputed. The dataset was subset to remove columns which contained all zero values.
3. Review data and identify columns with information not relevant to prediction task, e.g. user names, timestamps, etc. The dataset was subset to remove columns with only relevant data to minimize the impact on the model training/testing performance.
4. Dataset dimension were reviewed before and after subset to verify results.
5. Data processing steps were completed for train/test datasets.

* Note: The course mentor guides for random forest modeling was referenced to setup model training. Confusion matrix was used to verify results.
