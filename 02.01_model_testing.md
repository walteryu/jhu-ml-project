### Model Testing

Predictions were made on the test dataset after model training and verifying results with a confusion matrix. The dataset consisted of 20 user cases, so it was used to make predictions as follows:

1. Make new predictions on test data with trained model, i.e. predict on out-of-sample data.
2. Predictions were made on classe feature, i.e. were exercises completed correctly, etc.
3. Output predictions to verify results, i.e. predicted value for each use case.
